# Fullstack-Project
This is the official repository for the Full stack Project 2020-2021.

Topic : Bharat Bhraman: An Exploring India website

ABOUT PROJECT : 
This project is aimed at developing an online static website for the travellers through which one can visit the whole country online virtually as well as pick up the next destination for the tour without wasting any time. Searching or gathering information about the destination online saves us from any misconception, illusions.

The website is based on html, CSS and a little bit of javascript. This will facilitate the user in a very effective manner.

Our website will contain Home Page where all the basic information abput the whole country is displayed by using images and animations. Instead of the Home Page various other pages are also linked to the website i.e. About Us Page, Destinations Page, Cuisine Page. The website made by us is easy to operate and user friendly.
